Generate sports brackets for various sports

## General Purpose

The goal of this is to create sports brackets automatically with little manual input.

### How it should work

We should be able to input the team names / team numbers into a file somewhere. Maybe there should be something that will take those team names, count the number of teams with their corresponding names, and then place them aginst each other for round robin. There shouldn't be any replays against teams, I'm pretty sure.

Once there is a setup of which team is playing which team, I guess we can update something that calculates win/loss/point differential and then gives the seed of the teams.

After that I dunno if it's possible but I think we can make it so that it references the seeds of the teams along with their respective team names and then places them into brackets. Depending on the amount of teams, that would determine who gets a by.

Then I guess we just put who wins/loses and make it cool and graphical and animated or something lmao.

## Future Updates

- Functionality for multiple sports
